Changelog:
=========

Version 1.8:
* Brought back GPS mods - finally working (I hope)!

Version 1.7a:
* Added the option to override the "3-Fingers tap" gesture with either Google Hands-Free, Google Now or a custom app of your choice!
* Fixed the "_mainContext" global variable (it wasn't being set if Wi-Fi was set to 'Don't Change').
* Changed the defaults to be closer to the recommended settings rather than the stock settings. I figure if user install this mod, it means they want it to work out-of-the-box.
* Fixed a bug with the Toggler where it would launch the settings app instead of the car if triggered by 3rd party app (such as NFC or Tasker).

Version 1.6:
* Added the "App Toggler" which allows to shut down the car app through a global shortcut, or launch it if it's already closed.
* Fixed a bug where Wi-Fi would turn off even by navigating away from the Car app and not just closing it.
* GPS mods added back to code but not yet working (they're commented out for the git commit).


Version 1.5:
* Fixed "Multitasking"! Yes, the "Recent Apps" button now works and doesn't break anything! Thanks to the brilliant RichmondoUK for pointing me in the right direction.
* Removed GPS mods - it wasn't working as well as I had hoped due to android privacy overrides.

Version 1.4:
* Added 'Exit mods':
** Change GPS and Wi-Fi states on exit
** Close apps opened from the Car App (either using a regular shut-down which doesn't always work or the more powerful 'root' method).
* Moved the "Exit without confirmation" option under this category
* Some code touch-ups
* Version bump due to mis-fire on the publish button :-|

Version 1.2:
* Default settings will bow be applied upon installation.
* Added an option to bypass the exit confirmation dialog
* Added the option to turn GPS and Wi-Fi on or off at startup.
* You can also choose to - obviously - not change them at all.

Version 1.1:
* Interface added! You can now turn mods on and off selectively.
* Added the option to release the 'Home' button.
* New icon, slightly less ugly I hope.
