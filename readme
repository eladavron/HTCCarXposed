Changelog:
=========

Version 1.6:
* Added the "App Toggler" which allows to shut down the car app through a global shortcut, or launch it if it's already closed.
* Fixed a bug where Wi-Fi would turn off even by navigating away from the Car app and not just closing it.
* GPS mods added back to code but not yet working (they're commented out for the git commit).


Version 1.5:
* Fixed "Multitasking"! Yes, the "Recent Apps" button now works and doesn't break anything! Thanks to the brilliant RichmondoUK for pointing me in the right direction.
* Removed GPS mods - it wasn't working as well as I had hoped due to android privacy overrides.

Version 1.4:
* Added 'Exit mods':
** Change GPS and Wi-Fi states on exit
** Close apps opened from the Car App (either using a regular shut-down which doesn't always work or the more powerful 'root' method).
* Moved the "Exit without confirmation" option under this category
* Some code touch-ups
* Version bump due to mis-fire on the publish button :-|

Version 1.2:
* Default settings will bow be applied upon installation.
* Added an option to bypass the exit confirmation dialog
* Added the option to turn GPS and Wi-Fi on or off at startup.
* You can also choose to - obviously - not change them at all.

Version 1.1:
* Interface added! You can now turn mods on and off selectively.
* Added the option to release the 'Home' button.
* New icon, slightly less ugly I hope.
